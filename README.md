RheumActive (a play on the word 'rheumatic', that is, 'relating to or caused by rheumatism') is a system designed to track the joint range of motion for people with rheumatoid arthritis, like myself, and ultimately improve the quality of life for people with this disease. Using MPU-6050 accelerometers and an Arduino Nano ESP32, this software enables live data visualization and provides insights into joint movement, angular differences, and more. This repository contains the software required for collecting, processing, and visualizing data from the sensors.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Nano ESP32 (ABX00083)**
- **MPU-6050 Accelerometers (x2)**
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**
- **USB-C to USB-C/A Cable**
- **Laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux)**

---

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** (version 1.8.19 or later)
  - Install from [Arduino Official Website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rheumactive.git
cd rheumactive
```

### 2. Set Up the Arduino
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Install the necessary libraries using the Library Manager:
  - Search for "Adafruit MPU6050" and install it.
- Upload the provided `arduino_sketches/best/Arduino_Sketch_Dual_MVP_01.ino` file to the Arduino Nano ESP32.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Wire the Sensors:**
   - Wire the MPU-6050 sensors to the Arduino Nano ESP32 as follows (MPU-6050 on left, Arduino Nano ESP32 on right):
      - For both MPU-6050:
         - VCC -> 3.3V
         - GND -> GND
         - SCL -> A5
         - SDA -> A4
      
      - For MPU-6050 #1: AD0 -> 3.3V
      - For MPU-6050 #2: AD0 -> GND

   - Ensure each sensor has a unique I2C address (`AD0` pin set appropriately).

2. **Provide a Connection to the Sensors:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano ESP32 to your machine via a USB-C to USB-C/A cable.

3. **Run the Program:**
   - In terminal, open the repository and navigate to the `src` directory.
   - Execute the command `python main.py` to run the program.

4. **Connect to the Sensors:**
   - In the Serial Tab of RheumActive, choose the correct communication (COM) port (it should be the only one available) and select 'Connect'. If successful, the "Status" should change from "Not Connected" to "Connected".

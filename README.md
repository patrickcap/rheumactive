RheumActive (a play on the word 'rheumatic', that is, 'relating to or caused by rheumatism') is a system designed to track the joint range of motion for people with rheumatoid arthritis, like myself, and ultimately improve the quality of life for people with this disease. Using MPU-6050 accelerometers and an Arduino Nano ESP32, this software enables live data visualization and provides insights into joint movement, angular differences, and more. This repository contains the software required for collecting, processing, and visualizing data from the sensors.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rheumactive.git
cd rheumactive
```

### 2. Set Up the Arduino
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Install the necessary libraries using the Library Manager:
  - Search for "Adafruit MPU6050" and install it.
